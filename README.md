## Personal

#### Name: **Tri Tran**

#### Student ID:  s3947389

#### Email: s3947389@student.rmit.edu.au

#### Nationality: Vietnamese & Australian 

#### Language spoken: English & Vietnamese 

#### FUN FACT: I like to workout

#### What is your interest in IT?:
My fascination in IT stems from an ingrained passion in coding and constructing websites. Being able to program and create lines of code that can be used to create a multitude of interfaces that aim to maximise and implement a more efficient lifestyle. 

#### When did your interest in IT start?:
My interest in IT started when I took my first IT class in highschool. I was always fascinated with how technologies around us work and how they contribute to our society. Thinking about what technologies have done for the world really motivates me to pursue a career in IT.

#### Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest? Outline your IT Experience:
What caused my interest in IT was when I built my first PC. Learning about all the PC parts and what they do helps me understand how a computer functions. Technology is an essential part in our lives and plays a huge role in our ever-evolving-world and that’s why I want to further my studies in IT.


#### Why Did you choose to come to RMIT?
I chose to study at RMIT because it is recognised as one of the top universities for IT related courses. 
RMIT is also located in CBD, which is super convenient for me since I live near the area. This also 
means that I don’t have to spend hours on public transport to go to class and back home everyday.

#### What do you expect to learn during your studies?
During my time at RMIT, I hope to be exposed facets and nuances of the technological industry that
work in unison to optimise the way the public interacts with the many that they traverse throughout 
their day. Through my education in IT I am especially excited to gain the tools to give me the 
capacity to.

#### Describtions of job and appeal
In this job, you’re expected to be able to develop and engineer new web platforms. You’re also expected to 
write, test and maintain code to ensure all programs work smoothly to meet the clients requirements. This
job is appealing to me because I’m able to work from home with just my laptop with no fixed schedule  
as long as I get my job done on time and meet full requirements. This job will challenge me to learn new 
skills as I have to be able to adapt to all kinds of challenges, especially when under pressure. This job also 
require good problem-solving skills which is what I’m good at and allows me to keep honing my skills. The 
skills required for this job is that you have to be able to identify problems and solve them. Good 
communication skill is also needed as you need to deal with your client and help them fully understand 
what’s going on as someone who has limited knowledge on technologies. As of right now, I’m lacking in 
both of these skills and I’m planning to obtain them by finishing my degree of Bachelor of IT  at RMIT. I 
also plan to get internship in some company to get some experience with coding and how to deal with 
clients.


# Personal Profile
#### http://www.16personalities.com/
Result of online Myers-Briggs test:
The result I got from my Myers-Briggs test was Logician 

 
 
#### https://www.how-to-study.com/learning-style-assessment/
 Results of an online learning style test: 
The result I got from this test is that I’m a visual learner

 
#### https://www.truity.com/test/big-five-personality-test
Results of one further online test of your choosing (A Big 5 Personality quiz)
The result I took from this test is 

Opensess (65%)
Conscientiousness (50%)
Extraversion (35%)
Agreeableness (67%)
Neuroticism (62.5%)


#### What do the results of these tests mean for you?
In my opinion, a person's personality shouldn’t be defined by personality tests as they are only partially accurate and only provide a general idea of what the person’s personality is like. So to me, these tests don’t mean much and therefore I don’t give too much thought about them.


#### How do you think these results may influence your behavior in a team?
According to the Myers-Briggs test, I am an introvert which means I have trouble working with other people and often rather working by myself. However, I will try my best to cooperate with other people in my group and contribute as much as possible. 



#### How should you take this into account when forming a team?
I’m an open minded individual and easy to get along with so I don’t really care what the other person's personality is like as long as they put in the effort and contribute to the group. 

# Project Idea: Project Mate



#### Overview:  
Mate is a software designed for a mobile device with the intention to connect people with similar interests fostering meaningful relationships between people who are looking to expand their social circles. The selling point of mating is that it connects people with hobbies such as gymming, sports… Compared to other social media software available on mobile devices. Eg. tinder, east meet east. 



#### Motivation: 
 Being an introvert myself, I know that’s it can be hard to meet new people and even harder to find 
     people with similar interests. During my time in lockdown, finding people with similar hobbies and
     interests was challenging which motivate me to create this software which aims to help people create
     meaningful or just casual social relationships and encourage people to socialise with each other.




#### Description: 
 One of the thing that’s differentiate Mate from other social platforms currently on the market
     that it isn't  just exclusive to dating. The goal of Mate is to connect people with similar interests no matter
     it is. Things such as sports, hobbies, and other interests are included. The app interface will be similar to 
     tinders where you first sign up and make a profile. Making a profile in Mate is essential because this is 
     when you do a survey where you states all of your interests and what you are looking for in another person 
     that you want to start making a connection with. The app will then use the answers based on the survey 
     to link with other people that have matching/similar answers. The user can then read through other people 
     profiles and decides whether the person is fit to link up with by swiping left or right. If it a match, the app
     will notify both users that “They found a match” and will automatically set up a chat between them. Beside 
     the matching function, the app also allows users to shares their interest by posting their stories on the 
     platform which furthers their chances of finding that special one. Furthermore, the app will also give you 
     feeds and news based on your interests which includes other people’s stories. There will also be a forum
     board where other people can share and discuss about things that they like (eg. conspiracies, theories…)
     Another feature of Mate is that it can allow users to see each other location and where they are 
     (permission will be asked). This means that users will have much easier time to meet up and a ping will
     pop up if users that are linked are close to each other. The app will also track how many time and how long
     users link up for (if the users allowed of course) and it will be display on users profile (privately), much 
     similar to snapchat with their “snap scores”. The user can also check how many friends that has check 
     their location but without revealing the viewers. To engage with the users, the app will also rewards users
     for things such as logging on daily and reward with things like icons and emojis which can be obtain by 
     achieving goals such as logging on daily for 5 days straight. The rewards will be exclusive to users that 
     can achieve these certain goals. The application won’t be just limiting to texting and users will be able to 
    call each other and even video call. With all these features, the goal of Mate is to link like minded 
    individuals and hope to help people build relationships.







#### Tools and Technologies: 
The tool needed for this application is “Flutter”. Flutter is “Google’s mobile UI framework that provides a fast 
and expressive way” for developers to build native apps on both IOS and Android, using a single code base.
The language that will be used for this process is called “Dart”. Dart allows the code to get “compiled 
natively and used GPU to render a uniform UI”. Test subjects are also needed as surveying people on 
their experience with the app will be crucial to making any necessary changes.




#### Skills Required: 
The skill needed for this project is full understanding of how coding and programming works, especially
on mobile devices. Developers will also need to be able to use Dart coding language and Flutter to build 
the app UI. The aim of Mating is to be available on both platform, IOS and Android so developers have to 
have experience across apps on 2 different platforms.


#### Outcome:
   If the project is successful, I hope to see people can find that special someone to build relationships with
   and get people more sociable as we humans are social species. I also hope this app can help people stay
   connected with each other no matter where they are. I want to see people to use this app as a tool 
   to meet new people and make friends with people like themselves.
